# Game Rules
Palace is a game simulation for the Palace card game.

## Equipment:

The Palace game is played on a table that displays the player's hand, their three hidden cards, and their three revealed cards. In the center, a deck of cards with a counter over them will display the number of cards left in the deck.

## Game Play:

At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt three cards face down, which will be arranged in a line. These are called your hidden guard cards. Then, each player will get another six cards and pick 3 to put down face up right above the three face-down cards. These will be called your guard. Then, the game begins when a card is taken from the top of the deck and placed face up in the center of the table; we will call this the pile. The player, clockwise to the dealer, will have to place a card with a higher number than the one on the pile or place a number 2 card that will reset the pile. Then, itâ€™s the next player's turn. If there are still cards in the deck, the player will pick up the number of cards needed to have three cards if the player has less than three cards in his hand. 

The card values go from 3-9, then Queen, King, and Ace. With each turn, the player must have a higher level card than the one on the top of the pile, or they will have to take the whole pile to their hand. 

Finally, once a player has no cards in his hand and no more cards are on the deck, he will use the guard cards first. Once you have expended your guard cards, you will gain access to a single hidden guard card, which the player will pick randomly. If, during this process, you have to pick up the pile, you must expend all the cards in your hand before you can go on to use your hidden guard cards.

## Objective
A player wins the game once he has expended all the cards in his hand, hidden guard cards, and guard cards. 

## Strategies

### Basic
The player picks the first valid card.
### Lowest First
The player plays the lowest possible number.
### Highest First
The player plays the highest possible number.
### Hoarder
The player holds valuable cards like a high number and two cards so they can reset the pile whenever they want and they can force the next player to pick up the pile by putting down high level cards.
